3. **Legal Implications**:
   - Kickbacks are illegal in many jurisdictions, including under anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act.
   - Companies and individuals caught engaging in kickbacks can face hefty fines, imprisonment, and reputational damage.

4. **Impact on Businesses**:
